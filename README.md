# [Linux] Privilege Escalation by injecting process posseding sudo tokens.

#### Inject process that have valid sudo token and activate our own sudo token.

## Introduction

We all noticed that sometimes sudo doesn't ask us for a password because he remembers us. How does he remember us and how does he identify us, can we falsify our identity and become *root*?
As far as I know this research is not yet documented, but let me know if it is.
Indeed sudo creates a file for each linux user in /var/run/sudo/ts/[username].
These files contain both successful and failed authentications, then sudo uses these files to remember the authenticated processes. -- [@chaignc][]

This repository provides you:
* A way to gain root privilege by abusing sudo tokens (Don't be too happy there are requirements).
* A tool to forge sudo tokens for a given process. (write_sudo_token in ./extra_tools/).
* A tool to parse sudo tokens for forensic. (read_sudo_token_forensic and read_sudo_token in ./extra_tools).
* A technique to transform any root arbitrary file write into stable root code execution.  


## How to exploit a vulnerable system
PS: read requirements!!
```sh
$ sudo whatever
[sudo] password for user:    # Press <ctrl>+c since you don't have the password. # This creates an invalid sudo tokens.
$ ./exploit.sh # This activates our sudo token.
.... wait 1 seconds
$ sudo -i # no password required :)
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Requirements
* Ptrace fully enabled (cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope == 0).
* Current user must have living process that has a valid sudo token with the same uid.

```
The default password timeout is 15 minutes. So if you use sudo twice in 15 minutes (900 seconds), you will not be asked to type the userâ€™s password again.
```

## What's happenning behind the scene?

Sudo uses 

## Usecase

This is far from a generic privesc without requirements but it works, for instance if you have a RCE and don't have the user password but the user uses sudo then you can easily get root by stealing his token.

## How to simulate in lab?

```sh
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
# # Don't worry this is persistent accross reboot
```
Start two terminals:
* one to type sudo and enter the right password (example: sudo ls).
* one to start the exploit as described above.

## Going further

### Forensic, DFIR ?

Printing to be improved but each process sudo attempt has one entry in /var/run/sudo/ts/[username]
```sh
./read_sudo_token_forensic  < /var/run/sudo/ts/user
version, flags, uid, sid, starttime_sec, starttime_nsec
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 0, 1001, 1145, 188, 660000000
2, 0, 1001, 24878, 7461, 490000000
2, 0, 1001, 24578, 6974, 10000000
```

### Arbitrary write to root

If you have an abitrary write you can create a sudo token for you current process to gain root code execution.
checkout './write_sudo_token $$ > /var/run/sudo/ts/[username]' in extra_tools,

### Golden sudo tickets

A very good way to create a secret root backdoor on servers that rarely reboots.
Not done yet but checkout './write_sudo_token $$' in ./extra_tools

### Why

I was looking for a way to steal dead process sudo token, but it doesn't look possible because they are associated by ((process start time and process session id) or (tty start time and tty session id)), and everything can be impressionnated except the start times which are relative to system boot time.
